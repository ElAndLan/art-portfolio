This is going to be an art portfolio project for my girlfriend. It is still in its early stages, and is used as a practice project for me learning
NextJS.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## ToDo

1. Format header properly as well as footer.
2. For header, make sure the "Home", "About" and "Contact" are sticky and always visible (Subheader), but the "M.M.E Art" should not be sticky (When scrolling up, it should disappear and just leave the subheader)
3. Format the grid layout better, and add functionality for left clicking image to pop up custom modal that shows the enlarged image with the title and _maybe_ a short description.
4. More to come!
